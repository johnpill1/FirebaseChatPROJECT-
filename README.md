# FirebaseChatPROJECT-

Simple chat application. 

This project was developed to test and lear to use Google's Firebase backend authorisation, storage, database and swift tools to create user accounts and store data including images and text related to each user. 
This is in anticpation of a future project I plan on developing. 

I also developed this project to further development my understanding of the ViewModel architecture. 

You are able to create and account. Log in with said account and message others with accounts.

Thanks to Brian Voong for the instruction on developing this project!
